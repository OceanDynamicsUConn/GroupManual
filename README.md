- [**Respect others**](code_of_conduct.md): abide by the code of conduct.
- [**Work hard**](./role_and_responsibilities.md): dedication begets success.
- [**Communicate with the group**](./communication.md): do not isolate from your peers.
- [**Take care of yourself**](physical_and_mental_health.md): your physical and mental health is paramount.
