# Research Group Guidelines

This is an evolving draft of guidelines for how to participate in the Ocean Dynamics
Research Group at UConn. These guidelines build on similar documents by
colleagues, including Ryan Abernathey, Katy Huff, and Baylor Fox Kemper

# The short version

- **Respect others**: abide by the code of conduct.
- **Work hard**: dedication begets success.
- **Communicate with the group**: do not isolate from your peers.
- **Take care of yourself**: your physical and mental health is paramount.

# The long version

## Respect others
All group members must review and comply with UConn's code of conduct and ethical
guidelines
([faculty and staff](https://policy.uconn.edu/2011/05/17/employee-code-of-conduct/),
[students](https://community.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/523/2020/09/20_21-The-Student-Code-1.pdf))
and complete the required training about harassment and discrimination.  As a UConn Professor,
Rocha is a mandatory reporter of harassment incidents, however small.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof),
and country of origin. It also includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, uninvited photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks (if it makes the speaker uncomfortable), inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is
inappropriate at our work place, including work-related social events and online media
(e-mail, slack).

If a group member engages in harassing behavior, Rocha and UConn may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning, temporary suspension, or expulsion from the group.

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns, please
immediately contact Rocha or UConn's [Office of Institutional Equity](https://equity.uconn.edu/discrimination/).**

Rocha commits to nurturing healthy and
intellectually stimulating work place, where all group members are able to do their
best work and achieve their potential. This requires that we all be open-minded and respect
the different opinions, personalities and learning styles of our fellow group members.
While we do not tolerate any form of harassment, we strongly encourage good-faith disagreement
and healthy skepticism––the lifeblood of science. Group members should be mindful, however,
that how others perceive our opinions and actions depends heavily on their background. Mindful of other people's sensibilities, and without being
tolerant with the intolerant, we
should cut each other some slack, educate one another, and
build a better work place together.
