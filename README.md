# Research Group Manual

This is an evolving draft of the Ocean Dynamics
Research Group manual. It establishes high standards for the group culture and 
defines roles and expectations for each group member. The ultimate goal of this
manual is to create a
safe and productive space for everyone in the group (including guests and
visitors).

The manual is summarized in four tenets:

- [**Respect others**](code_of_conduct.md): abide by the code of conduct.
- [**Work hard**](./roles_and_responsibilities.md): dedication begets success.
- [**Communicate with the group**](./communication.md): do not isolate from your peers.
- [**Take care of yourself**](physical_and_mental_health.md): your physical and mental health is paramount.

Click on each tenet for detailed guidelines.
