# Research Group Guidelines

This is an evolving draft of guidelines for how to participate in the Ocean Dynamics
Research Group at UConn. These guidelines build on similar documents by
colleagues, including Ryan Abernathey, Katy Huff, and Baylor Fox Kemper.

# The short version

- **Respect others**: abide by the code of conduct.
- **Work hard**: dedication begets success.
- **Communicate with the group**: do not isolate from your peers.
- **Take care of yourself**: your physical and mental health is paramount.

# The long version

## Respect others
All group members must review and comply with UConn's code of conduct and ethical
guidelines
([faculty and staff](https://policy.uconn.edu/2011/05/17/employee-code-of-conduct/),
[students](https://community.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/523/2020/09/20_21-The-Student-Code-1.pdf))
and complete the required training about harassment and discrimination.  As a UConn Professor,
Cesar is a mandatory reporter of harassment incidents, however small.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof),
and country of origin. It also includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, uninvited photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks (if it makes the speaker uncomfortable), inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is
inappropriate at our work place, which includes work-related social events and online media
(e-mail, slack).

If a group member engages in harassing behavior, Cesar and UConn may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning, temporary suspension, or expulsion from the group.

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns, please
immediately contact Cesar or UConn's [Office of Institutional Equity](https://equity.uconn.edu/discrimination/).**

Cesar commits to nurturing a healthy, productive, and
intellectually stimulating work environment, where all group members thrive.
This requires that we all be open-minded and respect
the different opinions, personalities and learning styles of our fellow group members.
While we do not tolerate any form of harassment, we strongly encourage healthy
skepticism and good-faith disagreement––the lifeblood of science. Group members should be mindful, however,
that the way others perceive our opinions and actions depends heavily on their background. Attuned to other people's sensibilities, and without being
tolerant with the intolerant, we
should cut each other some slack, educate one another, and
build a better work place together.

## Work hard: roles and responsibilities


### PI responsibilities
The group PI has diverse and challenging responsibilities.
These include:

1. **Define the overall direction of the group**:
  One of the PI's critical tasks is to identify
  interesting and relevant scientific problems
  for our group to puzzle over. This requires
  a broad and deep understanding of field and
  creativity and luck.

2. **Pursue funding**:
  The PI has the responsibility to pursue
  funds from federal agencies to support our
  research program. Getting extra-mural funding
  is crucial, because a graduate student
  at UConn costs tens of thousands of dollars per
  year. Going to the field to collect new data
  or buying computers and high-performance computing time
  to run numerical models and analyze data also
  costs a lot of money. Cesar's summer salary is also paid
  with extra-mural funds.

3. **Mentor students**:
   One of the most serious responsibilities
   of the PI is to mentor junior group members, shepherding
   them through the early stages of their career and helping
   them develop into confident, humble and independent scientists.
   (This applies even if the student wants to pursue a career in industry or
   government or the third sector.) The PI also
   works with students from other groups, serving as their associate advisor.
   For Cesar, mentoring is one of the satisfying parts of his job. He dedicates
   a lot of time to his students, but also expects a lot from them.

4. **Serve the department**:
   As a tenure-track professor, the PI is expected to serve the department. This includes
   attending regular department meetings, representing the department
   in college-wide and university-wide initiatives,  and occasionally
   serving on hiring committees. For Cesar, department service is the least fun
   part of his job.  

5. **Serve the community**:
   As an active scientist in the field of Physical Oceanography, the PI engages
   in scientific community service. This includes, serving on thesis committees,
   regularly reviewing
   manuscripts submitted to scientific journals and proposal submitted to funding
   agencies, and occasionally serving on review panels and professional
   organization committees.

6. **Teach graduate and undergraduate classes**:
    As a professor, the PI teaches undergrad or graduate classes at UConn every
    Fall and Spring semesters. Cesar is committed to pedagogical excellence, and teaching
    a great course is time-consuming, especially the first time through.   

7. **Conduct personal research**
    On top of all the above responsibilities, the PI conducts his personal research.
    For Cesar, this is the most fun part of his job.

### Graduate student responsibilities (or what I expect from you)

1. **Stay in good standing**:
    You must review all formal requirements of the
    [Graduate School](https://grad.uconn.edu/) and the [department](https://marinesciences.uconn.edu/).
    It is your responsibility to stay on top of coursework requirements and
    deadlines for registration, comprehensive and qualifying exams, committee meetings, etc.

2. **Succeed in your coursework**:
    The beginning of graduate school is dominated by coursework. Besides the required
    classes, you should talk to Cesar about taking extra classes that could be useful
    to your research topic and to your career in general. Succeeding in your
    coursework goes much beyond getting good grades. If you are a Master's student, having
    excellent grades may matter, because if you decide to pursue a PhD, the admissions
    committee will review your transcripts. If you are a doctoral student, grades
    don't matter much, because most prospective employers will not ask for your
    transcripts. What truly matters––both at the Master's and doctoral levels––is
    that you develop mastery of the material discussed in class. (You could
    be a straight-A student on paper but know little about the material.)  What
    will make you an excellent professional is a solid skillset (*de facto*,
    not *de jure*) coupled with a desire and an ability to quickly learn new things.

2. **Develop a research plan**:
    In consultation with Cesar, you should develop a long-term plan for your research,
    with clear goals and milestones. You should develop contingency plans
    and refine your long-term plan as your research project evolves. Cesar will
    use your research plan to assess whether you are making satisfactory progress
    towards your degree.

3. **Write an Individual Development Plan**:
    The department requires every graduate student to have an individual development
    plan, identifying short-term and long-term career goals, strengths and areas that
    need improvement. This is a great opportunity to reflect on your career
    plans and whether you are making good progress towards your general professional
    goals. Cesar will provide verbal and written feedback on your IDP.

4. **Focus on your research**:
    Research is the most important aspect of your graduate education, so it should
    be prioritized. You are funded with US tax-payer dollars to conduct research
    while you get your degree, a privilege enjoyed by very few Americans. You
    should approach your research seriously and professionally.

5. **Become independent**:  
    Your ultimate goal should be to become an independent scientist––even if you
    want to pursue a career outside research. While Cesar adopts a hands-on
    approach to advising, especially in the beginning of your tenure as a grad student,
    he also expects you to develop independence with time. Depending on your
    background and academic level, your emancipation will come earlier or later.  But it is never
    too early to become a self-starter. Don't wait to be told what to do. Read
    broadly, attend seminars, apply for conferences, download new datasets and
    software, develop code for new analyses. Take the initiative.

6. **Communicate with the group**:
    You must attend group meetings and one-on-one meetings with Cesar. You are
    also expected to communicate with your fellow group members more broadly
    (see communication section below).


### Expectations for "being present" and vacation
Making satisfactory progress towards your degree requires steadfast 
and diligent work. Here are some groud rules.

1. **Work schedule**:
    You should aim to work about 40 hours/week (8 hours/day during weekdays). *This is the 
    number you should submit in your bi-weekly time card report*. But Cesar won't keep track of your exact work hours, because the number of hours
    you put in matters less than the amount and quality of your work. The flexibility 
    and demands of our work (paper submission and revision deadlines, field  work, conferences) means that sometimes we may have to work long hours. This should be
    compensated by some time off within weeks of your bouts of excessive work. Working long hours for months to years is strongly discouraged (see physical and mental health remarks below).

2. **Expectations for "being present"**:
    While our work doesn't require a constant physical presence on campus (and so we easily adapted to remote work during the pandemic), the office still has a crucial role in our 
    work life. If you are easily distracted, coming to the office will help you develop a 
    structured work routine. At UConn, graduate students share offices with other students, and this provides an opportunity for you to develop a network of friends who will help you along the way, cheer you up when you have a bad day, and cheer you on as you walk to the finish line. 
    
    Our group also has a lab space, which we will use to for group meetings. You will have a key to the lab and are welcome to set up shop there, if you need some privacy.

    Of course, you may need to work remotely for many different reasons (life events, pandemic, bad weather). If your remote work is just for a few days, you don't need to notify Cesar, unless we have an in person meeting that you will miss (or have join in remotely). But if you decide to work remotely for a week or longer, you should first discuss your plans with Cesar.

3. **Weekly meetings**:
    We will hold weekly one-on-one meetings to discuss your work. These meetings aim to define the overall direction of your research and make sure you are making significant progress towards your degree.  You should prepare for the meetings, because Cesar will ask you to summarize what you have been working. We will address any questions you have and define plans for the following week. We will also hold group meetings where you will occasionally have to present the status of your current work.

4. **Office hours**:
    In addition to one-on-one meetings, Cesar will also hold daily office hours for group members. On a first come first serve basis, group members can drop by his office with any specific questions about your work. This is a good opportunity to chat with Cesar if you can't get your code to work or are stuck in a particular derivation. 

5. **Vacation and sick days**:
    UConn graduate students are entitled to a number of days of [paid leave](https://hr.uconn.edu/ga-leave-administration/) for some life events. Regardless of UConn's lack of paid vacation for graduate students, Cesar recommends that all group members take four weeks of vacation per year.
    Cesar will generally take two weeks of time off during Holidays, after the end of Fall Semester, and two weeks sometime in the summer. Cesar will notify you of his time off. You should notify him  at least two weeks in advance of your vacation plans.

## Communication  

All group members should often communicate with Cesar and the group. For administrative stuff (paperwork to sign, remote work and vacation notifications, etc), you should e-mail Cesar directly. For technical and scientific (technical python questions, interesting papers and scientific talks, etc) we should try our best to use the group's workspace on slack. Among other things, slack has the advantage of allowing us to easily share copy-and-past ready bits of code among the group (we may also use Github for that purpose). Cesar checks slack twice a day (morning and afternoon) to see if there are any questions that require his attention.

Cesar checks his e-mail only three times a day (early morning, mid-day, and late afternoon). For any urgent matter, please call his office or his personal phone. 

You are not expected to check your e-mail or slack very often. In fact, Cesar recommends that you develop productive e-mail and slack habits, which involve NOT working with your inbox open and de-activating any notifications (the kind of work we do requires concentration).  If you are working remotely, we will need a phone number to reach you if something urgent comes up.

## Physical and mental health

[Recent studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4089?fbclid=IwAR1ujMp2cpoUOm984Lruc8ZJiC_1RPWherKesyT7oESy5frdjbGxHBHzhpQ) suggest that most graduate students are prone to anxiety and many develop 
depression. Universities are slowly taking the initiative to tackle the root causes (at least the institutional ones) this mental health crisis. Cesar is also deeply committed to ensuring that his students enjoy a healthy and productive time at UConn. Here are a few guidelines to help us meet that goal.

1. **Do NOT overwork**:
Between classes and research, graduate school often can be demanding and stressful. While this is true, it is important to realize that most knowledge professions, which involve long-term projects and peer competition and sometimes unclear deadlines, are demanding and stressful. You should always remember that graduate work is a marathon not a sprint. So graduate school provides you with an opportunity to develop a healthy work-life balance that will not only get you to the finish line, but also prepare you for the career challenges that lie ahead. This involves developing new habits and overcoming bad ones, setting intentional short-term and long-term goals, and planning your semester and weeks and days. It also involves good sleep hygiene, among other heathy habits (exercise, meditation, deep breathing). Find what works best for you.

    Speaking from personal experience, Cesar can attest that if you overwork too much you will burn out. Burnout is [common among graduate students](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01451-9). And among other deleterious effects, burnout will suppress your productivity, potentially jeopardizing the very career goals you are working so hard towards.

    [Here](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/22) are some tips from young scientists to prevent burnout.

2. **Be careful with social media**:
Many scientists and students are now actively engaged in social media for many different reasons. Social media has benefits, such as allowing you to stay in touch with friends and family, network with people with shared interestes and goals, feel part of a community, and promote causes that you care about (digital activism). But there are many negative aspects that can cause you harm, such as exposure to cyberbullying and elevation of self-aborption, anxiety and depression, and even isolating (the oppositve of what social media purports to do). 

    While you are welcome to use social media as part of your work, you should develop a healthy relationship with the platforms you use. Do not confuse work with reading social media posts (even if those posts are related to your career goals and academic interests). Do not check your feeds more than once during your work hours. Do not turn on notification or e-mail alerts. Be mindful of what you read, write, and promote on social media––all your social media data are being collected and sold by Big Tech and may be used against you in the future. Be aware that social media heightens FOMO (fear of missing out). And remember that scientists are humans, and humans like attention (one of the most important commodities of our times).

3. **Collaborate with your colleagues**:
Unchecked competition is one the root causes of anxiety in academics. Our antidote against this evil is strong collaboration. Cesar enjoys collaborating with his students and encourages everyone in the group to collaborate with one anothers other. Share code and ideas with the group.  Help your colleague who can't get a code to work and are stuck on an analysis tasks. Help your classmate with homework (if allowed/encouraged by the instructor). Celebrate your colleague's accomplishments. 

    Of course, we all have our individual goals, so everyone should be mindful of each other's space and grateful for their generous time.

4. **Keep an eye on your peers**:
If you notice that a fellow group member is struggling, reach out and encourage them to seek help and talk to Cesar. There are many telltale signs of mental health issues you should be aware of, including prolonged sadness, confused thinking, excessive fears, extreme mood swings, and *withdrawal from friends, colleagues, and activities*.

5. **Seek help**: 
    If you or a friend are experiencing a mental health crisis, please seek help immediately at [UConn Student Health](https://studenthealth.uconn.edu/emergency-contacts/). If you are experiencing an unmanageable level of stress or have any related concerns, please seek help. UConn graduate students should explore all available resources at [UConn Student Health](https://studenthealth.uconn.edu/mental-health/). Cesar is also available to listen to your concerns, provide career advice, and help you develop a healthy work-life balance.
