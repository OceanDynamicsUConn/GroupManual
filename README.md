# Research Group Guidelines

This is an evolving draft of guidelines for how to participate in the Ocean Dynamics
Research Group at UConn. These guidelines build on similar documents by
colleagues, including Ryan Abernathey, Katy Huff, and Baylor Fox Kemper

## Tenets

- **Respect others**: abide by the code of conduct.
- **Work hard**: dedication begets success.
- **Communicate with the group**: do not isolate from your peers.
- **Take care of yourself**: your physical and mental health is paramount.

### Respect others
All group members must review and comply with UConn's code of conduct and ethical
guidelines
([faculty and staff](https://policy.uconn.edu/2011/05/17/employee-code-of-conduct/),
[students](https://community.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/523/2020/09/20_21-The-Student-Code-1.pdf))
and complete the required training about harassment and discrimination.  As a UConn Professor,
Rocha is a mandatory reporter of any incidents, however small, that violate UConn's policy and
bylaws.
