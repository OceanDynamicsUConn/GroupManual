# Research Group Guidelines

This is an evolving draft of guidelines for how to participate in the Ocean Dynamics
Research Group at UConn. These guidelines build on similar documents by
colleagues, including Ryan Abernathey, Katy Huff, and Baylor Fox Kemper

## Tenets

- **Respect others**: abide by the code of conduct.
- **Work hard**: dedication begets success.
- **Communicate with the group**: do not isolate from your peers.
- **Take care of yourself**: your physical and mental health is paramount.

### Respect others
All group members must review and comply with UConn's code of conduct and ethical
guidelines
([faculty and staff](https://policy.uconn.edu/2011/05/17/employee-code-of-conduct/),
[students](https://community.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/523/2020/09/20_21-The-Student-Code-1.pdf))
and complete the required training about harassment and discrimination.  As a UConn Professor,
Rocha is a mandatory reporter of violations, however small, to UConn's code of conduct.

Rocha is strongly committed to providing a harrassment-free experience for everybody, regardless of gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
Our group does not tolerate harrassment of group members and visitors of any form. Sexual language and imagery is
inappropriate at our work place, including work-related social events and online media
(e-mail, Twitter, slack).

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If a group member engages in harassing behavior, Rocha and UConn may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
immediately contact Rocha or UConn's [Office of Institutional Equity](https://equity.uconn.edu/discrimination/).
