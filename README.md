# Research Group Guidelines

This is an evolving draft of guidelines for how to participate in the Ocean Dynamics
Research Group at UConn. These guidelines build on similar documents by
colleagues, including Ryan Abernathey, Katy Huff, and Baylor Fox Kemper.

# The short version

- **Respect others**: abide by the code of conduct.
- **Work hard**: dedication begets success.
- **Communicate with the group**: do not isolate from your peers.
- **Take care of yourself**: your physical and mental health is paramount.

# The long version

## Respect others
All group members must review and comply with UConn's code of conduct and ethical
guidelines
([faculty and staff](https://policy.uconn.edu/2011/05/17/employee-code-of-conduct/),
[students](https://community.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/523/2020/09/20_21-The-Student-Code-1.pdf))
and complete the required training about harassment and discrimination.  As a UConn Professor,
Cesar is a mandatory reporter of harassment incidents, however small.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof),
and country of origin. It also includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, uninvited photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks (if it makes the speaker uncomfortable), inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is
inappropriate at our work place, which includes work-related social events and online media
(e-mail, slack).

If a group member engages in harassing behavior, Cesar and UConn may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning, temporary suspension, or expulsion from the group.

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns, please
immediately contact Cesar or UConn's [Office of Institutional Equity](https://equity.uconn.edu/discrimination/).**

Cesar commits to nurturing a healthy, productive, and
intellectually stimulating work environment, where all group members thrive.
This requires that we all be open-minded and respect
the different opinions, personalities and learning styles of our fellow group members.
While we do not tolerate any form of harassment, we strongly encourage healthy
skepticism and good-faith disagreement––the lifeblood of science. Group members should be mindful, however,
that the way others perceive our opinions and actions depends heavily on their background. Attuned to other people's sensibilities, and without being
tolerant with the intolerant, we
should cut each other some slack, educate one another, and
build a better work place together.

## Work hard: roles and responsibilities


### PI responsibilities
The group PI has diverse and challenging responsibilities.
These include:

1. **Define the overall direction of the group**:
  One of the PI's critical tasks is to identify
  interesting and relevant scientific problems
  for our group to puzzle over. This requires
  a broad and deep understanding of field and
  creativity and luck.

2. **Pursue funding**:
  The PI has the responsibility to pursue
  funds from federal agencies to support our
  research program. Getting extra-mural funding
  is crucial, because a graduate student
  at UConn costs tens of thousands of dollars per
  year. Going to the field to collect new data
  or buying computers and high-performance computing time
  to run numerical models and analyze data also
  costs a lot of money. Cesar's summer salary is also paid
  with extra-mural funds.

3. **Mentor students**:
   One of the most serious responsibilities
   of the PI is to mentor junior group members, shepherding
   them through the early stages of their career and helping
   them develop into confident, humble and independent scientists.
   (This applies even if the student wants to pursue a career in industry or
   government or the third sector.) The PI also
   works with students from other groups, serving as their associate advisor.
   For Cesar, mentoring is one of the satisfying parts of his job. He dedicates
   a lot of time to his students, but also expects a lot from them.

4. **Serve the department**:
   As a tenure-track professor, the PI is expected to serve the department. This includes
   attending regular department meetings, representing the department
   in college-wide and university-wide initiatives,  and occasionally
   serving on hiring committees. For Cesar, department service is the least fun
   part of his job.  

5. **Serve the community**:
   As an active scientist in the field of Physical Oceanography, the PI engages
   in scientific community service. This includes, serving on thesis committees,
   regularly reviewing
   manuscripts submitted to scientific journals and proposal submitted to funding
   agencies, and occasionally serving on review panels and professional
   organization committees.

6. **Teach graduate and undergraduate classes**:
    As a professor, the PI teaches undergrad or graduate classes at UConn every
    Fall and Spring. Cesar is committed to pedagogical excellence, and teaching
    a great course is time-consuming, especially the first time through.   

7. **Conduct personal research**
    On top of all the above responsibilities, the PI conducts his personal research.
    For Cesar, this is the most fun part of his job.

### Graduate student responsibilities (or what I expect from you)

1. **Stay in good standing**:
    You must review all formal requirements of the
    [Graduate School](https://grad.uconn.edu/) and the [department](https://marinesciences.uconn.edu/).
    It is your responsibility to stay on top of coursework requirements and
    deadlines for registration, comprehensive and qualifying exams, committee meetings, etc.

2. **Succeed in your coursework**:
    The beginning of graduate school is dominated by coursework. Besides the required
    classes, you should talk to Cesar about taking extra classes that could be useful
    to your research topic and to your career in general. Succeeding in your
    coursework goes much beyond getting good grades. If you are a Master's student, having
    excellent grades may matter, because if you decide to pursue a PhD, the admissions
    committee will review your transcripts. If you are a doctoral student, grades
    don't matter much, because most prospective employers will not ask for you
    transcripts. What matters most––both at the Master's and doctoral levels––is
    that you develop mastery of the material discussed in class. (You could
    be a straight-A student on paper but know little about the material.)  What
    will make you an excellent professional is a solid skillset (*de facto*,
    not *de jure*) coupled with a desire and an ability to quickly learn new things.

2. **Develop a research plan**:
    In consultation with Cesar, you should develop a long-term plan for your research,
    with clear goals and milestones. You should develop contingency plans
    and refine your long-term plan as your research project evolves. Cesar will
    use your research plan to assess whether you are making satisfactory progress
    towards your degree.

3. **Write an Individual Development Plan**:
    The department requires every graduate student to have an individual development
    plan, identifying short-term and long-term career goals, strengths and areas that
    need improvement. This is a great opportunity to reflect on your career
    plans and whether you are making good progress towards your general professional
    goals. Cesar will provide verbal and written feedback on your IDP.

4. **Focus on your research**:
    Research is the most important aspect of your graduate education, so it should
    be prioritized. You are funded with US tax-payer dollars to conduct research
    while you get your degree, a privilege enjoyed by very few Americans. You
    should approach your research seriously and professionally.

5. **Become independent**
    Your ultimate goal should be to become an independent scientist––even if you
    want to pursue a career outside research. While Cesar adopts a hands-on
    approach to advising, especially in the beginning of your tenure as a grad student,
    he also expects you to develop independence.  It is never
    too early to become a self-starter. Don't wait to be told what to do. Read
    broadly, attend seminars, apply for conferences, download new datasets and
    software, develop code for new analyses. Take the initiative.

6. **Communicate with the group**:
    You must attend group meetings and one-on-one meeting with Cesar. You are
    also expected to communicate with your fellow group members more broadly
    (see communication section below).


### Expectations for "being present" and vacation
All group members should take four weeks of vacation per year.
