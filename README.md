# Research Group Guidelines

This is an evolving draft of guidelines for how to participate in the Ocean Dynamics
Research Group at UConn. These guidelines build on similar documents by
colleagues, including Ryan Abernathey, Katy Huff, and Baylor Fox Kemper.

# The short version

- **Respect others**: abide by the code of conduct.
- **Work hard**: dedication begets success.
- **Communicate with the group**: do not isolate from your peers.
- **Take care of yourself**: your physical and mental health is paramount.

# The long version

## Respect others
All group members must review and comply with UConn's code of conduct and ethical
guidelines
([faculty and staff](https://policy.uconn.edu/2011/05/17/employee-code-of-conduct/),
[students](https://community.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/523/2020/09/20_21-The-Student-Code-1.pdf))
and complete the required training about harassment and discrimination.  As a UConn Professor,
Cesar is a mandatory reporter of harassment incidents, however small.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof),
and country of origin. It also includes deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, uninvited photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks (if it makes the speaker uncomfortable), inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is
inappropriate at our work place, which includes work-related social events and online media
(e-mail, slack).

If a group member engages in harassing behavior, Cesar and UConn may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning, temporary suspension, or expulsion from the group.

**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns, please
immediately contact Cesar or UConn's [Office of Institutional Equity](https://equity.uconn.edu/discrimination/).**

Cesar commits to nurturing a healthy, productive, and
intellectually stimulating work environment, where all group members thrive.
This requires that we all be open-minded and respect
the different opinions, personalities and learning styles of our fellow group members.
While we do not tolerate any form of harassment, we strongly encourage healthy
skepticism and good-faith disagreement––the lifeblood of science. Group members should be mindful, however,
that how others perceive our opinions and actions depends heavily on their background. Attuned to other people's sensibilities, and without being
tolerant with the intolerant, we
should cut each other some slack, educate one another, and
build a better work place together.

## Work hard: roles and responsibilities


### PI responsibilities
The group PI has diverse and challenging responsibilities.
These include:

1. **Define the overall direction of the group**:
  One of the PI's critical tasks is to identify
  interesting and relevant scientific problems
  for our group to puzzle over. This requires
  a broad and deep understanding of field and
  creativity and luck.

2. **Pursue funding**:
  The PI has the responsibility to pursue
  funds from federal agencies to support our
  research program. Getting extra-mural funding
  is crucial, because a graduate student
  at UConn costs tens of thousands of dollars per
  year. Going to the field to collect new data
  or buying computers and high-performance computing time
  to run numerical models and analyze data also
  costs a lot of money. Cesar's summer salary is also paid
  with extra-mural funds.

3. **Mentor students**:
   One of the most serious (and fun) responsibilities
   of the PI is to mentor junior group members, shepherding
   them through the early stages of their career and helping
   them develop into confident, humble and independent scientists.
   (This applies even if the student wants to pursue a career in industry or
   government or the third sector.)

4. **Serve the department**

5. **Serve the community**

6. **Teach graduate and undergraduate classes**

7. **Conduct personal research**


### Graduate student responsibilities (or what I expect for you)

1. **Stay in good standing**

2. **Develop a research plan**

3. **Write an Individual Development Plan**

4. **Become independent**

5. **Communicate with the group**


### Vacation and expectations for "being present"
All group members should take four week of vacation per year.
