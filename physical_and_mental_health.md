# Physical and mental health

[Recent studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4089?fbclid=IwAR1ujMp2cpoUOm984Lruc8ZJiC_1RPWherKesyT7oESy5frdjbGxHBHzhpQ) suggest that most graduate students are prone to anxiety and many develop 
depression. (This [worsened with the
pandemic](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00663-2).) Universities
are slowly taking the initiative to tackle the root causes (at least the
institutional ones) this mental health crisis. Cesar is also deeply committed
to ensuring that his students enjoy a healthy and productive time at UConn.
Here are a few guidelines to help us meet that goal:

1. **Do NOT overwork**:
Between classes and research, graduate school often can be demanding and
stressful. While this is true, it is important to realize that most knowledge
professions, which involve long-term projects and peer competition and
sometimes fuzzy deadlines, are demanding and stressful. You should always
remember that graduate work is a marathon not a sprint. So graduate school
provides you with an opportunity to develop a healthy work-life balance that
will not only get you to the finish line, but also prepare you for the career
challenges that lie ahead. This involves developing new habits and overcoming
bad ones, setting intentional short-term and long-term goals, and diligently planning your semester and weeks and days. It also involves good sleep hygiene, among other heathy habits (exercise, meditation, deep breathing). Find what works best for you.

    Speaking from personal experience, Cesar can attest that if you overwork
    too much you will burn out. Burnout is [endemic in graduate
    school](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01451-9). And among
    other deleterious effects, burnout will suppress your productivity,
    potentially jeopardizing the very career goals you are working so hard
    towards. [Here](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6448/22) are
    some burnout-prevention tips from young scientists.

2. **Be careful with social media**:
Many scientists and students are now actively engaged in social media for many different reasons. Social media has benefits, such as allowing you to stay in touch with friends and family, network with people with shared interestes and goals, feel part of a community, and promote causes that you care about (digital activism). But there are many negative aspects that can cause you harm, such as exposure to cyberbullying, elevation of self-aborption, anxiety and depression, and even isolation (the oppositve of what social media purports to do). 

    While you are welcome to use social media as part of your work, you should develop a healthy relationship with the platforms you use. Do not confuse work with reading social media posts (even if those posts are related to your career goals and academic interests). Do not check your feeds more than once during your work hours. Do not turn on notification or email alerts. Be mindful of what you read, write, and promote on social media––all your social media data are being collected and sold by Big Tech and may be used against you in the future. Be aware that social media heightens FOMO (fear of missing out). And remember that scientists are humans, and humans like attention (one of the most important commodities of our times).

3. **Collaborate with your colleagues**:
Competition drives science forward, but too much of it causes anxiety. While we
do not demonize competition, we strongly believe in collaboration. Cesar enjoys
collaborating with his students and encourages everyone in the group to
collaborate with one another. Share code and ideas with the group.  Help your
colleague who can't get a code to work or are stuck on an analysis tasks. Help your classmates with homework (if allowed/encouraged by the instructor). Celebrate your colleague's accomplishments. 

    Of course, we all have our individual goals, so everyone should be mindful of each other's space and grateful for their generous time.

4. **Keep an eye on your peers**:
If you notice that a fellow group member is struggling, reach out and encourage them to seek help and talk to Cesar. There are many telltale signs of mental health issues you should be aware of, including prolonged sadness, confused thinking, excessive fears, extreme mood swings, and *withdrawal from friends, colleagues, and activities*.

5. **Seek help**: 
    If you or a friend are experiencing a mental health crisis, please seek help immediately at [UConn Student Health](https://studenthealth.uconn.edu/emergency-contacts/). If you are experiencing an unmanageable level of stress or have any related concerns, please seek help. UConn graduate students should explore all available resources at [UConn Student Health](https://studenthealth.uconn.edu/mental-health/). Cesar is also available to listen to your concerns, provide career advice, and help you develop a healthy work-life balance.
