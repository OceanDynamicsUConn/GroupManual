# Communication  

All group members should often communicate with Cesar and the group. For
administrative stuff (paperwork to sign, remote work and vacation
notifications, etc), you should email Cesar directly. For technical and
scientific (technical python questions, interesting papers and scientific
talks, etc) we should try our best to use the group's workspace on Microsoft
Teams. Among other things, Teams has the advantage of allowing us to easily
share copy-and-paste ready bits of code among the group (we may also use Github
for that purpose). Cesar checks Team twice a day (morning and afternoon) to see if there are any questions that require his attention.

Cesar typically checks his email two times a day (morning and afternoon), so
you should expect a one-day reponse turnaround of one day during the week. For
urgent matters, please call his office or personal phone. 

You are not expected to check your email or Teams very often. In fact, Cesar recommends that you develop productive e-mail and slack habits, because the kind of work we do requires concentration. This e-mail hygiene involves NOT working with your inbox open and de-activating notifications.  If I need something urgent from you, I will come to your office (if you are working on campus) or call you (if you are working remotely).

*You are not expected to check your email or Teams on weekends and holidays*.
